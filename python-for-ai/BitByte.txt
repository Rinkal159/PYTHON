* 3 byte = white
meaning
rgb(255, 255, 255) = white, because every section of rgb holds one byte(8 bits).
because

128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1 
 1    1   1   1  1  1  1  1

it sums up to 255, and it is 8 bits meaning 1 byte, that is why every rgb section is equal to one byte or less..

* 3 == 7
  3 means our three fingers
  7 means our three fingers too! 111 in binary.
